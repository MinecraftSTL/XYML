# LWJGL Unsafe Agent

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.glavo/lwjgl-unsafe-agent)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.glavo/lwjgl-unsafe-agent)

Minecraft 26.1 uses LWJGL 3.4.1, which uses the Java FFM API to access native memory on JDK 25+.

However, due to limitations in JDK's optimization capabilities, some methods in `MemoryUtil` cannot be correctly inlined in some cases, resulting in a significant performance drop.

This project provides an Agent that modifies the bytecode of these methods to ensure they can be correctly inlined, thereby improving performance.

## Usage

First, download the latest release from the [release page](https://github.com/HMCL-dev/lwjgl-unsafe-agent/releases).

Then add the following JVM argument to your Minecraft launch options:

```
-javaagent:path/to/lwjgl-unsafe-agent.jar
```
